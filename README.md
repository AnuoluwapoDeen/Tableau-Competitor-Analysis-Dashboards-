INTRODUCTION

In today's fast-paced business world, it is essential to stay ahead of the competition. For companies in the video games industry, understanding their competitors' strengths and weaknesses can be the key to success. To this end, I created three dashboards using Tableau, one for each competitor (Playstation, Nintendo, and Xbox), to assist our clients in analyzing and evaluating the video games industry's competitive landscape.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

My client, a video game company, was seeking to gain a deeper understanding of their position in the market and identify areas of improvement. They were particularly interested in investigating how video games sales developed over time, which platform was most popular, and which were its their most popular games and genres to understanding their strengths and weaknesses as compared to that of competitors across different platforms and genres.

BUSINESS QUESTION

What are the strengths and weaknesses of our client's competitors across different platforms and genres?
What areas of focus should our client prioritize to improve their competitive position?
